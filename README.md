# Pokédex

Welcome to my Tkinter GUI project based on a Pokédex from The series/franchise Pokémon. 
This project will center around the PyPokdex Library for functionaility and the framework Tkinter for styliing.

When planning to make this project, I found some useful functionaility and libaries to help escort me to the destination I was seeking. 
The overall purpose of this project is to design and customize according to a theme, which is why I chose tkinter as the framework.

What is a Pokédex?
The Pokédex keeps track of the Pocket Monster also known as Pokémon you've seen and caught within game. 
Use the Pokédex to learn more about the different species of Pokémon and their Evolutions. There are 1,025 Pokémon in total.
